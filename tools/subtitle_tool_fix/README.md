### Use this tool if your subtitle is slower than the audio in your movie, technically if your subtitle is behind the audio

### It'll prompt for a time, you can get the time by checking the time where the first language or human speech was made in the movie, input that time in first prompt
### would look like this ``00:00:10`` meaning first speech was made 10 seconds in the movie and maybe the sub title starts at 25th second or 2 mins 25 seconds, it'd correct it by subtracting your input time from the original time in the subtitle file.
