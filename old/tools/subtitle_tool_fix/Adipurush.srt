1
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:03,063
India has a history filled with
notable accomplishments,

2
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:06,063
but the most remarkable chapter
in this history is the one

3
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:10,730
that tells the story of
The Righteous Shri Ram.

4
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:15,063
The grandeur of Shri Ram
cannot be fully expressed

5
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:19,063
even if millions of aeons were to pass.

6
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,230
Ram's greatness transcends

7
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:23,938
words and speech,

8
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:31,521
and yet he manifests
in the voices of all.

9
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:35,021
Each author portrayed Shri Ram's story

10
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:37,313
based on their own personal
perception of Shri Ram.

11
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:40,438
He is Infinite his story Everlasting,

12
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:43,188
A story narrated by many
saints over ages.

00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:50,105

My son Bharat should be crowned
king of Ayodhya.

22
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:52,313
And Raghav should
be exiled for 14 years.

23
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,938
It's always been Raghukul's custom

24
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,521
We'd rather die...

25
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:59,146
than break a promise.

26
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,271

For those who are born.

37
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:43,771
Death is certain

38
00:06:45,146 --> 00:06:47,688
I cannot change destiny.

39
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:51,396
However, I can grant you
a boon for anything...

40
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:53,896
but immortality.

41
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:02,980
I know you are adamant.

42
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:13,938
I...

43
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:16,355
Brahma, creator of the universe

44
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,521
bestows this boon upon you.

45
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,521
Neither in the night nor in the day,

46
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,563
neither in the water nor in the air,

47
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:31,105
neither on the ground nor in the sky,

48
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:36,730
neither at the hands of Gods or demons

49
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,355
shall death ever befall on you.

50
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:41,105
Something doesn't seem right, Shesh.

51
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:46,438
Why fear these clouds.

52
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:02,688
This is not a normal sky.

53
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,605
Something is wrong.

54
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,605
I can sense it.

55
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:38,563
What is this?

56
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:41,230
The line of Truth.

57
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:43,813
As long as we're within its bounds,

58
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:46,605
no evil can ever harm us.

59
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:59,021
But your brother is still out there.

60
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:02,438
Shesh...

61
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,688
They are nothing but moths.

62
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:06,271
And my brother is fire.

63
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,521
A moth cannot destroy fire,
only be consumed by it.

64
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:13,105
But where is he?

65
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:22,438
♪ Matted hair, formidable,

89
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,146
Pardon me, Lord Shiva.

90
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:39,646
Why have you covered your face,
Shurpanakha?

91
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,605
Remove the veil.

92
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:45,313
Look at me.

93
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,480
Even if I do...

94
00:21:48,271 --> 00:21:51,105
will I see my same old brother?

95
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,480
The very same brother
who once dethroned King Kuber...

96
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,146
simply because he mocked me?

97
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,271
I am still the same, Shurpanakha.

98
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,605
What a sight!

99
00:22:33,813 --> 00:22:35,313
Such radiance

100
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,271
on such a handsome young man.

101
00:22:43,313 --> 00:22:45,855
I gladly accept you as my husband.

102
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:49,896
I'm a married man.

103
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:55,563
Please forgive me.

104
00:23:04,605 --> 00:23:06,063
Who is she?

105
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:09,938
Tell me who this woman is

106
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:13,105
who has deprived my sister
of her true love.

107
00:23:14,438 --> 00:23:15,688
Janaki.

108
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,313
The wife of Raghav.

109
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:22,355
The most beautiful woman
in the universe.

110
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:33,563
She is the perfect embodiment
of heavenly charm

111
00:24:35,563 --> 00:24:39,146
and eternal beauty.

112
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,271
She is not meant to be in the jungle.

113
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:47,730
She is the missing piece in your life.

114
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:54,396
If there is anything missing
in Raavan's life

115
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:57,063
that is Janaki

116
00:25:01,105 --> 00:25:03,688
Get her and complete yourself

117
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:08,188
my revenge will be complete.

118
00:25:42,063 --> 00:25:44,021
Something's bothering you.

119
00:25:44,438 --> 00:25:45,688
Talk to me.

120
00:25:50,438 --> 00:25:52,355
You are a princess, Janaki.

121
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:55,271
You belong to the palace.

122
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,521
Why roam around in these jungles with me?

123
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,688
There is still time.

124
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:12,563
Listen to me.

125
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:14,688
Go back to Ayodhya.

126
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:18,438
You do not have to worry
about such things with me.

127
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:25,355
Why should I go back to Ayodhya?

128
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:27,105
For me,

129
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:29,396
my Ayodhya is where...

130
00:26:31,063 --> 00:26:32,688
my Raghav is.

131
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:38,563
Your shadow may leave you alone,

132
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:42,813

Let's take it along

145
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:41,771
on our return to Ayodhya.

146
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,188
Such a beautiful golden deer

147
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:48,605
No one would have seen in Ayodhya.

148
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:02,105
Shesh!

149
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:10,771
Did you hear that?

150
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:12,605
Your brother calls for you.

151
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,605
He must be in danger.

152
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:32,105
Shesh!

153
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:35,480
Hear that?

154
00:30:35,938 --> 00:30:37,438
Do you believe me now?

155
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:40,396
I am scared...

156
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,938
You must go right now and help him.

157
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:44,438
But I cannot leave you here alone.

158
00:30:44,855 --> 00:30:45,646
It isn't safe.

159
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,938
But your brother is in danger!

160
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:04,980
Come what may,

161
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,771
you must not cross this line.

162
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,646
Grant me some alms.

163
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:42,896
Spare some alms for a sage.

164
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:44,938
And the universe

165
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,063
will bless you.

166
00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:54,646
Can't you spare some food for a sage?

167
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:00,146
Even some water will do.

168
00:33:05,146 --> 00:33:06,105
Yes...

169
00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:08,480
I'll get you something.

170
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,396
Please accept these alms.

171
00:33:29,313 --> 00:33:31,896
A sage has walked miles
to your doorstep,

172
00:33:32,438 --> 00:33:35,105
and you can't even take two steps
to hand them over?

173
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:39,896
My husband isn't home yet.

174
00:33:40,355 --> 00:33:42,063
And until he returns, I must not--

175
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:44,396
You dare question the character
of a sage?

176
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,813
Not at all baba

177
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:46,980
I apologize.

178
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:50,605
I'm leaving.

179
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:56,230
Never forget,

180
00:33:57,063 --> 00:34:00,021
if a sage leaves empty-handed
from you doorstep

181
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,563
Good Fortune abandons that house.

182
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:16,521
And I was about to give my blessings
for your husband's longevity.

183
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,605
It would've been wise of you
to have accepted.

184
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:25,230
But as you wish

185
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:29,980
In the wake of impending doom
even one's intellect falters.

186
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:32,521
Please wait.

187
00:38:48,396 --> 00:38:49,855
Jatayu!

188
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:29,480
Jatayu!

189
00:43:40,896 --> 00:43:42,230
Who are you?

190
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:47,230
Raavan.

191
00:44:56,021 --> 00:44:57,730
This is all my fault, brother.

192
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,396
Had I not left her alone,

193
00:45:03,105 --> 00:45:04,438
none of this would've happened.

194
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,313
I have broken your trust.

195
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:14,146
It's not your mistake, Shesh.

196
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:18,730
It is clearly a play of destiny.

197
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:26,521
I carry a debt from long...

198
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:32,230
I wasn't able to cremate our father.

199
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:40,688
But doing so for his friend Jatayu...

200
00:45:44,188 --> 00:45:47,188
might help reduce my debt.

201
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:35,396
You finally got your revenge...

202
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:38,063
Congratulations.

203
00:48:38,813 --> 00:48:41,813
And yet you do not seem
so happy about it,

204
00:48:42,438 --> 00:48:43,813
Queen Mandodari.

205
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,813
Because you haven't bothered to think...

206
00:48:49,771 --> 00:48:51,271
of the mayhem it will lead us to.

207
00:48:53,188 --> 00:48:57,271
The fact that my brother has brought
the most beautiful woman to marry

208
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:01,688
you are unable to bear the same!

209
00:49:02,355 --> 00:49:03,230
Am I right?

210
00:49:06,938 --> 00:49:09,730
The days of Lanka's glory
are nearing its twilight.

211
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,396
So, rejoice while you still can.

212
00:49:16,646 --> 00:49:18,688
The inevitable doom is here.

213
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,771
Get ready...

214
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:39,105
We need an army to attack Raavan.

215
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:42,480
You are the prince of Ayodhya.

216
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,730
And she is the future queen.

217
00:49:51,271 --> 00:49:54,730
All you need do is say but one word,
and our army will be here.

218
00:49:56,355 --> 00:49:57,605
No, Shesh.

219
00:49:58,355 --> 00:49:59,688
But why not, brother?

220
00:50:01,188 --> 00:50:03,021
This is against my righteousness.

221
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,646
Today I am not a prince

222
00:50:06,188 --> 00:50:08,188
I am just a nomad,

223
00:50:09,146 --> 00:50:11,355
and Janaki is my wife.

224
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:16,480
Not just Ayodhya's army,

225
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:21,980
I cannot claim privileges over even
a single grain of sand for 14 years.

226
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:24,063
So is your righteousness more valuable

227
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,855
to you than sister-in-law's life?

228
00:50:43,146 --> 00:50:45,480
Janaki is my life.

229
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:51,730
But my righteousness

230
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,563
is more precious than my life.

231
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,146
Stop!

232
00:52:56,771 --> 00:52:59,313
An old woman roaming the jungle
in the dark of night.

233
00:53:00,646 --> 00:53:01,730
Definitely a ruse.

234
00:53:01,938 --> 00:53:02,938
Speak, woman!

235
00:53:03,063 --> 00:53:05,771
Reveal yourself or be prepared to die!

236
00:53:06,438 --> 00:53:08,105
I will not stop you, son.

237
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:12,563
If I am an illusion
it will do me no harm.

238
00:53:13,105 --> 00:53:15,313
But if I turn out to be a human,

239
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:20,813
your hands will forever be stained
with the blood of an innocent.

240
00:53:20,938 --> 00:53:22,188
Shesh.

241
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,271
No, please.

242
00:53:53,771 --> 00:53:55,771
Why are you doing this, son?

243
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:00,980
It doesn't suit you to sit at my feet.

244
00:54:02,605 --> 00:54:04,688
I belong to a lower caste,

245
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:06,521
and you...

246
00:54:06,938 --> 00:54:09,313
you look like a warrior

247
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,771
and possibly even a prince.

248
00:54:12,355 --> 00:54:13,480
So please don't.

249
00:54:13,605 --> 00:54:15,313
Don't do this to me.

250
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:22,230
Our deeds define our character,
not our birth.

251
00:54:25,605 --> 00:54:27,605
You are like a mother to me.

252
00:54:28,605 --> 00:54:32,688
And this is the way a son
will always treat his mother.

253
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,730
Please eat.

254
00:54:38,313 --> 00:54:41,230
Brother, they're half-eaten.

255
00:54:42,438 --> 00:54:43,730
I wouldn't do it.

256
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:50,230
Have some.

257
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:57,063
They are the sweetest ones.

258
00:54:58,021 --> 00:54:59,396
Eat.

259
00:54:59,938 --> 00:55:01,521
I took bites from all the berries

260
00:55:01,605 --> 00:55:04,438
to ensure I serve only
the sweetest ones.

261
00:55:05,938 --> 00:55:08,313
You should also take some.

262
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:13,646
I have been waiting for you.

263
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,146
My guru rightly said...

264
00:55:19,105 --> 00:55:21,730
"He will not discriminate."

265
00:55:22,063 --> 00:55:24,313
"He will treat everyone equally."

266
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:29,355
I was so assured of your arrival.

267
00:55:41,063 --> 00:55:42,688
Our paths have crossed,

268
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:46,521
there is nothing more for me to live for.

269
00:55:49,188 --> 00:55:50,980
I'll take your leave.

270
00:56:44,563 --> 00:56:46,605
Across Pampa Lake,

271
00:56:47,146 --> 00:56:48,896
on the mountain Rishyamukha,

272
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:51,605
there resides a monkey king,
Sugriv.

273
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:53,230
You should go meet him.

274
00:56:53,271 --> 00:56:55,396
He will help you in your quest.

275
00:57:47,188 --> 00:57:51,105
Do you know what are the most dangerous
weapons are in the universe?

276
00:57:53,813 --> 00:57:55,313
Pashupatastra,

277
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:57,730
Narayanastra,

278
00:57:59,355 --> 00:58:00,855
and Brahmastra.

279
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,605
I was attacked with them,
all three of them

280
00:58:06,646 --> 00:58:08,938
yet here I am, standing before
you without a single scratch.

281
00:58:09,021 --> 00:58:10,396
Do you know why?

282
00:58:11,271 --> 00:58:12,855
Because I am Raavan,

283
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,396
the one who is far beyond the reach
of pain and agony.

284
00:58:19,605 --> 00:58:21,938
Alas! You broke this illusion of mine

285
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:24,563
in here!

286
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,855
It aches right here.

287
00:58:27,646 --> 00:58:29,688
For the first time,
I feel pain and agony.

288
00:58:30,313 --> 00:58:32,188
My eyes cannot bear
to see you like this -

289
00:58:32,271 --> 00:58:33,521
Starving to death.

290
00:58:34,105 --> 00:58:37,105
Looking so forlorn and sad.

291
00:58:38,271 --> 00:58:41,105
The future queen of Lanka
doesn't need to live like this.

292
00:58:42,021 --> 00:58:43,771
She should be in my palace.

293
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,063
The walls of my golden castle
beg your presence.

294
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,480
They keep asking for you,
"Where is Janaki?"

295
00:58:49,563 --> 00:58:52,105
"When will she grace
us with her presence?"

296
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:54,313
"When will Janaki come?"

297
00:58:56,521 --> 00:58:58,396
What do I tell them?

298
00:58:59,646 --> 00:59:02,730
When will my Janaki come?

299
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:04,688
Mind your words, Raavan!

300
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,271
Janaki belongs to Raghav.

301
00:59:09,438 --> 00:59:11,438
And she will always be his.

302
00:59:13,646 --> 00:59:15,105
Raghav!

303
00:59:15,688 --> 00:59:17,146
That fool!

304
00:59:19,896 --> 00:59:22,105
Who was fooled by just a deer?

305
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:24,313
Why ask me?

306
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,771
Why don't you ask Raghav himself

307
00:59:28,646 --> 00:59:30,271
once he comes to take me back?

308
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:35,480
Take you back?

309
00:59:41,396 --> 00:59:42,896
Open your eyes, Janaki.

310
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:45,021
Look around you.

311
00:59:45,521 --> 00:59:46,688
You are not in Mithila,

312
00:59:46,771 --> 00:59:49,563
where Raghav will come
with a procession to marry you.

313
00:59:49,646 --> 00:59:51,146
This is Lanka!

314
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,855
This is Raavan's Lanka!

315
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:57,521
An unsurpassable ocean and my undefeatable
powers will keep you two apart.

316
00:59:58,271 --> 01:00:00,480
Nothing enters here unless
I allow it to.

317
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,313
He will crush your fragile ego.

318
01:00:03,355 --> 01:00:05,355
He'll turn the ocean into a desert.

319
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:08,855
Just wait and watch.

320
01:00:11,355 --> 01:00:12,521
Not here!

321
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:14,605
In your golden palace.

322
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,938
And take your trivial baubles with you.

323
01:00:29,355 --> 01:00:31,980
There isn't enough gold in your Lanka

324
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,980
to even win a fraction of Janaki's love.

325
01:00:52,938 --> 01:00:56,105
Bhole-bhole, bam-bam bhole.

326
01:00:57,396 --> 01:01:00,480
Bhole-bhole, bam-bam bhole.

327
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:03,188
Bhole-bho--

328
01:01:04,938 --> 01:01:08,313
I was calling out to the Almighty,

329
01:01:08,646 --> 01:01:11,688
but instead, you two lost souls emerged
seemingly out of nowhere.

330
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:15,105
This is a forest of illusions
and enchantments.

331
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:19,605
You are not safe in this place.

332
01:01:20,021 --> 01:01:21,313
Turn back!

333
01:01:21,521 --> 01:01:23,730
And return from whence you came from!

334
01:01:24,521 --> 01:01:25,480
Now go.

335
01:01:25,771 --> 01:01:27,105
And what are you?

336
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,980
Illusionist or impostor?

337
01:01:29,355 --> 01:01:31,313
Reveal your identity...

338
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,313
or be prepared to face my wrath.

339
01:01:36,938 --> 01:01:39,271
The trickeries of this world
are quite abundant...

340
01:01:39,813 --> 01:01:42,563
but they aren't a sage's cup of tea.

341
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,188
You claim to be a sage.

342
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,188
Do you mind if I test your wisdom?

343
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,730
I welcome it!

344
01:01:50,646 --> 01:01:51,938
Here we go.

345
01:01:52,855 --> 01:01:57,188
If ten laborers built a palace
in four months,

346
01:01:57,813 --> 01:02:01,063
how much time will five laborers take?

347
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:02,605
No time at all.

348
01:02:02,688 --> 01:02:04,230
The palace is already built.

349
01:02:07,813 --> 01:02:10,021
A man hasn't slept for 20 days

350
01:02:10,646 --> 01:02:12,313
and yet is healthy.

351
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:14,021
How so?

352
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,980
Because he only sleeps at night.

353
01:02:17,605 --> 01:02:19,355
There's a parrot and its two chicks,

354
01:02:19,396 --> 01:02:21,063
they're crossing a river.

355
01:02:21,688 --> 01:02:23,438
As they reach the shore,

356
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,355
the youngest shouts,

357
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,938
We four have managed
to cross the river!

358
01:02:30,396 --> 01:02:31,730
Now answer me this, sage.

359
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:34,313
There are only one parrot
and two chicks.

360
01:02:34,396 --> 01:02:35,313
So the count should be three.

361
01:02:35,396 --> 01:02:36,980
Why did the chick say that
there are four of them.

362
01:02:37,063 --> 01:02:38,855
It's a chick, it can say anything.

363
01:03:21,563 --> 01:03:23,188
Why this façade?

364
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,480
What was the need to do all of this?

365
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:12,563
Pardon me, Raghav.

366
01:04:13,438 --> 01:04:16,980
I needed to ensure it was you

367
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:22,480
and not some impostor
who was pretending to be you.

368
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:24,605
And what's your judgment?

369
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:27,521
Am I an impostor?

370
01:04:30,688 --> 01:04:31,980
Raghav.

371
01:04:34,855 --> 01:04:36,105
How can I help?

372
01:04:37,438 --> 01:04:39,771
I want to meet the monkey king Sugriv.

373
01:05:08,896 --> 01:05:10,480
Welcome, Raghav.

374
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:12,730
Tell me...

375
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:15,146
what can I do for you?

376
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,730
My wife has been abducted, Sugriv.

377
01:05:20,938 --> 01:05:22,938
I came here to ask for your help.

402
01:08:57,605 --> 01:08:58,980
Raghav.

403
01:09:03,771 --> 01:09:05,480
I need to speak with you.

404
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:09,438
Forgive me if I have placed you
in a difficult situation.

405
01:09:09,521 --> 01:09:10,813
No, not at all.

406
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:14,230
It would be my pleasure
to be of service.

407
01:09:18,271 --> 01:09:19,438
But then,

408
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,396
I've no army,

409
01:09:22,105 --> 01:09:23,313
no kingdom.

410
01:09:24,146 --> 01:09:26,271
My elder brother Vali took
everything I had.

411
01:09:30,105 --> 01:09:32,771
Then why not claim your rights back?

412
01:09:33,063 --> 01:09:34,521
Fight for it.

413
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:38,896
He is as shrewd as he is strong.

414
01:09:39,646 --> 01:09:43,855
I could match his strength on the battlefield
but not his cunning.

415
01:09:44,855 --> 01:09:47,438
But with the truth on my side,

416
01:09:47,855 --> 01:09:49,771
I can definitely beat Vali.

417
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,230
And you are the truth, Raghav.

418
01:10:01,438 --> 01:10:03,271
So, get ready Sugriv.

419
01:10:08,521 --> 01:10:12,730
You shall challenge him to
a duel tomorrow.

420
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,188
Vali!

421
01:10:34,646 --> 01:10:35,730
Vali!

422
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:37,563
Come out!

423
01:10:40,438 --> 01:10:41,813
Come out!

424
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,313
Face me, you coward!

425
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,188
Sugriv is weak.

426
01:12:26,896 --> 01:12:28,313
We may have made a mistake.

427
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,313
We should have gone to Vali.

428
01:12:30,938 --> 01:12:31,980
He is strong,

429
01:12:32,396 --> 01:12:33,855
and the one with an army.

430
01:12:33,938 --> 01:12:36,480
Why are we supporting Sugriv?

431
01:12:41,146 --> 01:12:44,730
Forgive the intrusion, but it's forbidden
to use a weapon in a combat duel.

432
01:13:33,271 --> 01:13:35,021
It matters not how strong
the evil appears.

433
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:39,896
Truth always wins in the end.

434
01:13:46,438 --> 01:13:49,480
A king protects his people,
and that's his dharma.

435
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,230
That makes Surgiv the rightful king.

436
01:15:08,355 --> 01:15:12,438
It will take a while to reach Lanka
with this army.

437
01:15:15,688 --> 01:15:18,646
What if we send a small group ahead?

438
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:22,438
I will accompany Angad...

439
01:15:22,771 --> 01:15:24,063
along with Bajrang.

440
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:32,271
We will ask Janaki to stay strong,
and inform her about your plans.

441
01:15:33,438 --> 01:15:35,813
I agree with Jamavant.

442
01:15:36,771 --> 01:15:38,146
As you wish, Raghav.

443
01:15:49,188 --> 01:15:50,855
Show this to her when you find her.

444
01:15:52,063 --> 01:15:53,230
She will recognize it

445
01:15:53,313 --> 01:15:54,605
and trust you to be my messenger.

446
01:16:22,938 --> 01:16:23,646
Lankesh...

447
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:26,188
Must you be so formal outside of court,
Vibhishan.

448
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:33,188
Brother, you should let Janaki go.

449
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:46,521
If a suggestion is correct,

450
01:16:46,646 --> 01:16:48,896
it doesn't matter who said it.

451
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,146
You already have everything
this world has to offer,

452
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:54,896
but you still remain a Demon.

453
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,980
So?

454
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:02,980
Make Lakshmi your consort
and you will become Narayan.

455
01:17:03,188 --> 01:17:05,021
As long as Raghav is alive,

456
01:17:05,438 --> 01:17:08,188
you don't stand a chance
of winning her heart.

457
01:17:08,563 --> 01:17:11,063
Nothing is impossible for Raavan!

458
01:17:11,313 --> 01:17:14,605
Even the god of death is afraid of him.

459
01:17:14,688 --> 01:17:17,855
It's not about doing the impossible.

460
01:17:18,605 --> 01:17:22,813
This act would be a blight
on his entire legacy.

461
01:17:23,646 --> 01:17:27,271
The winner writes the legacy,

462
01:17:28,688 --> 01:17:30,688
never the loser.

463
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,938
And once Raavan has decided
to do something,

464
01:17:35,271 --> 01:17:38,313
the chains of morality can't restrain him.

465
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:40,313
I believe Raghav has magical powers.

466
01:17:43,063 --> 01:17:46,021
One ten headed Raavan
is more powerful than ten Raghav...

467
01:17:59,771 --> 01:18:01,188
I won't let her go.

468
01:18:06,896 --> 01:18:10,188
Then you are inviting death upon yourself,
my brother.

469
01:18:10,896 --> 01:18:13,563
I can see no other outcome.

470
01:18:26,646 --> 01:18:28,188
It seems this is where our journey ends.

471
01:18:28,396 --> 01:18:30,396
We can't cross the ocean.

472
01:18:42,146 --> 01:18:43,188
Bajrang!

473
01:18:43,688 --> 01:18:44,771
No, no!

474
01:18:44,938 --> 01:18:46,688
Don't you dare look at me like that.

475
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:51,813
How am I supposed to cross
the infinite ocean?

476
01:18:52,063 --> 01:18:54,688
As infinite as your potential, Bajrang.

477
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:58,188
Or have you forgotten who you truly are?

478
01:18:59,396 --> 01:19:01,355
A mere monkey, what else?

479
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,063
A monkey,

480
01:19:04,313 --> 01:19:07,855
who in his childhood once swallowed
the sun because he was hungry.

481
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:17,980
A monkey who has been endowed
with the power of three worlds.

482
01:19:20,771 --> 01:19:23,313
A monkey with the power of lightning

483
01:19:23,438 --> 01:19:26,105
and the radiance that matches Fire.

484
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:31,646
A monkey who possesses the force
of a storm.

485
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:34,688
A monkey with the power of lightning
and the glide of an eagle.

486
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:37,605
And here you are afraid
of crossing the sea?

487
01:19:39,855 --> 01:19:42,480
Bajrang, realize your own powers.

488
01:19:43,105 --> 01:19:45,146
Only you alone can do it.

489
01:19:45,396 --> 01:19:47,563
No one else but you, my friend.

490
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,771
Now jump, Bajrang!

491
01:20:28,396 --> 01:20:29,855
Wherever Raghav is,

492
01:20:31,105 --> 01:20:32,563
there lies victory.

493
01:21:37,646 --> 01:21:38,980
Who are you?

494
01:21:39,105 --> 01:21:42,271
I am Raghav's messenger, Bajrang.

495
01:21:43,813 --> 01:21:46,313
I have come to bring a message,
an important one.

496
01:21:47,105 --> 01:21:49,230
Raghav is on his way to rescue you.

497
01:21:52,146 --> 01:21:53,521
How is he doing?

498
01:21:55,355 --> 01:21:56,730
Not so good...

499
01:21:57,438 --> 01:21:58,896
without you by his side.

500
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:14,105
Please wipe away those tears.

501
01:22:15,105 --> 01:22:17,063
I cannot tell Raghav

502
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:20,438
that his Janaki was in tears.

503
01:22:21,938 --> 01:22:23,646
He won't like that.

504
01:22:27,855 --> 01:22:29,021
You, there!

505
01:22:30,105 --> 01:22:31,646
How did you manage to get in?

506
01:22:33,605 --> 01:22:36,813
This isn't a playground,
that you can drop in for a stroll.

507
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:40,438
Did you think you would be able
to escape my wrath?

508
01:22:40,938 --> 01:22:42,980
Do you even know who I am?

509
01:22:44,563 --> 01:22:46,021
Dhakdasur!

510
01:22:47,188 --> 01:22:48,688
Now, prepare yourself,

511
01:22:48,855 --> 01:22:51,313
and get ready to bid adieu
to this world!

512
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:54,980
I won't.

513
01:22:55,438 --> 01:22:57,146
But someone definitely will.

514
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:24,938
Don't you have better things to do...

515
01:24:29,271 --> 01:24:31,188
than to catch a monkey?

516
01:24:32,396 --> 01:24:33,938
This one speaks.

517
01:24:34,855 --> 01:24:37,521
He was caught chatting with Janaki
in Ashok Vatika.

518
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:48,771
Raghav must have sent him...

519
01:24:49,063 --> 01:24:50,355
to spy on us.

520
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,980
And in Lanka the punishment for spying

521
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:56,980
is death.

522
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,771
What say you, father?

523
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:04,271
At least ask him his name, Indrajit.

524
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:06,146
I am Bajrang.

525
01:25:07,355 --> 01:25:09,355
A messenger of Ayodhya's...

526
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:11,355
future king, Raghav.

527
01:25:12,563 --> 01:25:13,938
King?

528
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:18,646
He doesn't live in Ayodhya anymore.

529
01:25:20,063 --> 01:25:21,688
Instead, he roams the jungle.

530
01:25:22,813 --> 01:25:24,896
So, what kind of king does
that make him?

531
01:25:26,063 --> 01:25:27,146
Tell me.

532
01:25:28,105 --> 01:25:29,980
A king of vagabonds?

533
01:25:31,063 --> 01:25:32,438
Lankesh!

534
01:25:33,688 --> 01:25:35,855
He's a messenger and not a spy.

535
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:39,980
And here in Lanka,
we never kill a messenger.

536
01:25:42,605 --> 01:25:44,438
We can keep him in a cage.

537
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:48,813
Lanka needs a monkey that speaks
in its collection.

538
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,980
Father, what are you thinking?

539
01:25:56,646 --> 01:25:58,146
Just say the word.

540
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:03,396
Imagine what a monkey looks like
without its tail.

541
01:26:26,146 --> 01:26:27,313
Does it hurt?

542
01:26:31,021 --> 01:26:33,813
It gets worse with each passing moment.

543
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:39,521
To tell you honestly...

544
01:26:40,396 --> 01:26:42,271
I actually feel...

545
01:26:42,605 --> 01:26:44,396
a little bad for you.

546
01:26:52,188 --> 01:26:54,438
Cloth from Lanka

547
01:26:55,313 --> 01:26:57,188
Oil from Lanka

548
01:26:58,105 --> 01:27:00,396
Fire also from Lanka

549
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:03,896
and what will burn down
will also be Lanka.

550
01:29:03,563 --> 01:29:05,563
Please come with me.

551
01:29:17,355 --> 01:29:21,313
Raghav had broken the Shivdhanush
to marry me.

552
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:28,313
Now he must break Raavan's arrogance.

553
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:35,146
Raavan dared to take me away
from our doorstep.

554
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:38,980
Now Janaki will only return

555
01:29:41,563 --> 01:29:43,521
when Raghav comes for her.

556
01:29:47,605 --> 01:29:49,105
I know he will.

557
01:30:07,688 --> 01:30:09,605
I am waiting for him.

558
01:30:31,896 --> 01:30:33,605
Break boulders,

559
01:30:34,021 --> 01:30:35,771
tear down mountains,

560
01:30:36,396 --> 01:30:38,063
fill up the ocean,

561
01:30:38,146 --> 01:30:40,438
and build me a bridge to Lanka.

562
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:42,438
Go.

563
01:31:00,896 --> 01:31:03,396
I'm afraid even if we use all the rocks
in the world

564
01:31:04,271 --> 01:31:06,563
we will never have enough to build
the bridge we need.

565
01:31:08,813 --> 01:31:10,896
We have to build a bridge.

566
01:31:12,146 --> 01:31:13,855
If not with rocks,

567
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,188
then with our prayers.

568
01:31:26,188 --> 01:31:27,730
Oh, Sea God,

569
01:31:29,188 --> 01:31:33,855
I, Raghav, son of Dashrath, implore you

570
01:31:34,688 --> 01:31:36,980
to make way for my army.

571
01:32:14,355 --> 01:32:15,563
What happened, Bajrang?

572
01:32:15,771 --> 01:32:17,021
Nothing.

573
01:32:17,313 --> 01:32:19,313
Just a lesson that laying hands
on our women

574
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,938
would lead to their destruction.

575
01:32:42,313 --> 01:32:43,521
Janaki?

576
01:32:44,105 --> 01:32:45,313
Alive and well.

577
01:33:06,605 --> 01:33:08,688
I am forever indebted, Bajrang.

578
01:33:08,771 --> 01:33:10,188
My lord.

579
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:13,605
She awaits you.

580
01:33:14,813 --> 01:33:17,688
Before Raavan does anything untoward.

581
01:33:20,855 --> 01:33:22,980
You must reach Lanka.

582
01:34:00,063 --> 01:34:01,771
Sea God,

583
01:34:02,355 --> 01:34:05,646
you know that
I am going to fight for justice.

584
01:34:10,646 --> 01:34:12,855
Please make way for me.

585
01:35:22,855 --> 01:35:25,980
I, Raghav, from the Ikshavaku clan...

586
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:40,271
am forced to let this Brahmastra
pierce your heart.

587
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:13,688
Mercy, Raghav! Mercy!

588
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:16,521
I am the Sea.

589
01:36:17,646 --> 01:36:20,271
One can't measure my depth

590
01:36:20,646 --> 01:36:23,563
nor go across me.

591
01:36:24,313 --> 01:36:26,605
Such is the nature of my being.

592
01:36:27,771 --> 01:36:30,855
Such is your nature,
that you cannot be cross

593
01:36:31,271 --> 01:36:34,271
but such is my determination that I must cross
the great, wide sea and reach Lanka.

594
01:36:35,521 --> 01:36:40,646
It is said that so pious is your name
that people's worries dissolve

595
01:36:41,771 --> 01:36:44,271
Therefore, I request your army

596
01:36:44,646 --> 01:36:48,355
to throw stones in the sea
while taking your name,

597
01:36:49,105 --> 01:36:51,730
and I promise
I won't let those stones sink.

598
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,938
Wherever Raghav is,

599
01:37:14,355 --> 01:37:15,730
there lies victory.

600
01:37:41,938 --> 01:37:43,271
Wherever Raghav is...

601
01:37:43,605 --> 01:37:45,355
There lies victory!

602
01:37:45,438 --> 01:37:46,730
Wherever Raghav is...

603
01:37:47,355 --> 01:37:48,980
There lies victory!

604
01:37:54,396 --> 01:37:56,771
Now even if the earth breaks open
or the sky falls upon us,

605
01:37:58,313 --> 01:38:01,938
nothing could stop the hands of justice
from strangling evil.

606
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:05,646
My brave monkey brethren,

607
01:38:07,438 --> 01:38:10,021
No one has the gall to hinder
your path now.

608
01:38:11,396 --> 01:38:13,230
No one would even dare!

609
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:18,980
The very mountains
of the Earth would tremble

610
01:38:19,063 --> 01:38:20,688
the second we set foot on their land.

611
01:38:23,605 --> 01:38:27,730
Arrows of arrogance cannot
pierce your mighty chests.

612
01:38:30,188 --> 01:38:32,980
For you are fearless warriors with
burning fire flowing through your veins

613
01:38:33,063 --> 01:38:34,896
you are my true fearless warriors.

614
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:46,521
Raavan!

615
01:38:47,313 --> 01:38:48,563
I am coming for you.

616
01:38:48,646 --> 01:38:51,938
I am coming to crush each
and every one of your ten heads!

617
01:38:54,813 --> 01:38:57,646
I am coming to get my Janaki back!

618
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,438
I am coming...

619
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:06,730
to do justice once and for all.

620
01:39:49,188 --> 01:39:55,771
♪ Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Ram,
Jai Shri Ram, Raja Ram! ♪

621
01:39:55,896 --> 01:40:02,396
♪ Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Ram,
Jai Shri Ram, Raja Ram! ♪

622
01:40:29,813 --> 01:40:31,855
I understand this is treason, my lord.

623
01:40:33,188 --> 01:40:35,355
I am going against my brother.

624
01:40:36,188 --> 01:40:38,855
But if it helps me protect
my motherland.

625
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,563
Even if I have to betray my brother.

626
01:40:42,646 --> 01:40:44,021
So be it.

627
01:40:44,813 --> 01:40:47,563
I am aware that history will perhaps
remember me as a traitor.

628
01:40:48,771 --> 01:40:51,980
That I might not get the respect
I deserve after I am gone.

629
01:40:52,896 --> 01:40:56,646
But I cannot just do nothing
and watch Lanka getting destroyed.

630
01:41:02,105 --> 01:41:06,021
What Lankesh is doing
is not right, Raghav.

631
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:12,646
So, I have decided to against him
and join your ranks.

632
01:41:17,646 --> 01:41:19,980
And what do you expect in return?

633
01:41:20,771 --> 01:41:22,938
I ask for a promise, Raghav.

634
01:41:23,730 --> 01:41:27,188
That you wouldn't punish the people
of Lanka for Lankesh's misdeeds.

635
01:41:27,688 --> 01:41:29,730
They are innocent.

636
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:34,230
I ask you to spare them from this war.

637
01:41:34,313 --> 01:41:36,438
Haven't you been in a war before?

638
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:40,230
The citizens have to face the consequences

639
01:41:40,688 --> 01:41:42,396
of the actions of their king.

640
01:41:46,396 --> 01:41:48,146
It's Raavan who is the wrongdoer,

641
01:41:48,396 --> 01:41:49,646
not the people of Lanka.

642
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:52,688
You have my word.

643
01:41:52,855 --> 01:41:55,563
No innocent lives will be lost
in this war.

644
01:41:58,063 --> 01:42:02,313
And I expect nothing in return,
Vibhishan.

645
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:08,313
It's up to you to take
your brother's side or not.

646
01:42:09,563 --> 01:42:12,563
You are not compelled to join me.

647
01:42:17,271 --> 01:42:20,938
You can choose to remain neutral.

648
01:42:21,605 --> 01:42:24,896
In the war of good and evil,
choosing to remain neutral...

649
01:42:25,396 --> 01:42:27,646
is equivalent to committing a sin.

650
01:42:29,188 --> 01:42:30,980
I am with you, Raghav.

651
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:36,938
Please accept my allegiance.

652
01:42:48,271 --> 01:42:49,646
Welcome, my friend.

653
01:42:57,605 --> 01:43:01,646
Consider this as a token
of my acceptance.

654
01:43:06,105 --> 01:43:07,813
Once I defeat Raavan...

655
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,438
you shall be crowned as king of Lanka.

656
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:15,605
Why would you do that?

657
01:43:15,896 --> 01:43:17,688
You don't have a kingdom yourself.

658
01:43:18,188 --> 01:43:21,230
Who in their right mind
would let such a chance go?

659
01:43:21,396 --> 01:43:22,688
I don't understand this.

660
01:43:24,396 --> 01:43:26,021
Why would you not want to be the king?

661
01:43:26,105 --> 01:43:28,521
I'm fighting to get Janaki back

662
01:43:29,146 --> 01:43:32,146
and to put an end to Raavan's injustice.

663
01:43:34,021 --> 01:43:36,771
Lanka must remain in the stewardship
of its people.

664
01:43:42,271 --> 01:43:43,730
The greed for another kingdom

665
01:43:45,021 --> 01:43:47,563
and to secure a place in heaven
is never sated.

666
01:43:48,563 --> 01:43:49,980
So how come Raghav,

667
01:43:51,063 --> 01:43:52,230
a mere human,

668
01:43:53,438 --> 01:43:58,521
is so ready to sacrifice Lanka's crown
for a stranger like you?

669
01:44:08,688 --> 01:44:10,021
Are you even listening?

670
01:44:11,313 --> 01:44:14,730
That day the whole kingdom of Ayodhya was
at the height of rejoicing

671
01:44:15,355 --> 01:44:17,396
like a sky full of stars.

672
01:44:19,063 --> 01:44:20,563
The crowned prince of Ayodhya,

673
01:44:21,355 --> 01:44:23,563
the eldest son of King Dashrath,

674
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,855
Raghav would be crowned
on that fateful day.

675
01:44:27,188 --> 01:44:28,230
And then...

676
01:44:29,313 --> 01:44:32,855
You had promised me two wishes,
your highness.

677
01:44:33,938 --> 01:44:35,230
I have come to claim them.

678
01:44:36,896 --> 01:44:39,646
First, my son Bharat is to be made king
of Ayodhya.

679
01:44:41,230 --> 01:44:44,938
And second,
send Raghav into exile for 14 years.

680
01:44:45,605 --> 01:44:47,271
Kaikai!

681
01:44:56,521 --> 01:44:59,396
It's always been Raghukul's custom

682
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:01,896
We'd rather die...

683
01:45:02,855 --> 01:45:04,480
than break a promise.

684
01:45:09,146 --> 01:45:11,688
I gladly accept the exile.

685
01:45:13,146 --> 01:45:14,355
Ayodhya...

686
01:45:14,730 --> 01:45:16,605
will be ruled by Bharat.

687
01:45:35,938 --> 01:45:38,605
If in order to keep a promise made
by his father,

688
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:42,438
he can give him the throne
and agree to live a nomad's life,

689
01:45:43,938 --> 01:45:45,980
imagine the lengths he would go to

690
01:45:47,021 --> 01:45:48,271
in order to keep his own.

691
01:46:09,688 --> 01:46:11,646
I have come empty-handed today.

692
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:14,771
Without the worldly things...

693
01:46:16,896 --> 01:46:19,230
You don't want them,

694
01:46:19,938 --> 01:46:21,480
so I didn't get anything.

695
01:46:23,313 --> 01:46:25,688
In fact, I have come without
my royal guards

696
01:46:26,188 --> 01:46:27,480
and my weaponry.

697
01:46:28,271 --> 01:46:30,855
I came here with but one thing.

698
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:32,521
My heart...

699
01:46:33,313 --> 01:46:35,355
I offer you my heart as a gift, Janaki.

700
01:46:36,146 --> 01:46:37,980
Please accept it and come with me.

701
01:46:38,563 --> 01:46:40,355
Please accept my love.

702
01:46:41,313 --> 01:46:42,771
What kind of gift is that, Raavan?

703
01:46:46,188 --> 01:46:49,730
Gifts are meant to last.

704
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:54,188
Why would you offer something that
would stop working

705
01:46:55,896 --> 01:47:00,313
as soon as Raghav
impales it with an arrow?

706
01:47:01,938 --> 01:47:04,355
Now let's not argue over who Raghav is,

707
01:47:04,438 --> 01:47:06,730
or I'll be forced to remind you that

708
01:47:07,355 --> 01:47:10,563
a mere messenger of his was able
to wreak such havoc.

709
01:47:11,105 --> 01:47:12,521
Just imagine

710
01:47:13,938 --> 01:47:15,521
what'll happen to your kingdom

711
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:17,480
once Raghav gets here.

712
01:47:22,563 --> 01:47:24,396
Words can't persuade you then.

713
01:47:27,771 --> 01:47:29,855
You won't change your mind?!

714
01:47:31,063 --> 01:47:34,896
You've only seen my good side,
but now, you'll witness the bad!

715
01:47:36,188 --> 01:47:42,105
No one will mourn over his dead body
save for vultures!

716
01:47:42,188 --> 01:47:45,521
I will crush his heart with my feet
and do the tandav dance.

717
01:47:45,605 --> 01:47:48,480
In the fierce fire burning on his
formidable forehead,

718
01:47:48,563 --> 01:47:51,646
Lord Shiva had burnt Kamadeva to ashes.

719
01:47:55,063 --> 01:47:56,313
Just like this.

720
01:48:00,355 --> 01:48:02,146
Please listen to me, Janaki!

721
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:06,938
I am ready to be your slave,

722
01:48:08,021 --> 01:48:09,605
Please say yes to my love.

723
01:48:24,855 --> 01:48:26,855
I knew she would not say yes.

724
01:48:26,938 --> 01:48:28,355
She is stubborn.

725
01:48:30,313 --> 01:48:32,188
You are the one who is so stubborn.

726
01:48:32,521 --> 01:48:34,396
Why were you shouting so loudly?

727
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,938
Why wouldn't I?

728
01:48:36,021 --> 01:48:37,271
She won't give in.

729
01:48:40,063 --> 01:48:42,563
She was the princess of Mithila,
Raavan.

730
01:48:43,063 --> 01:48:44,771
You can't tempt her with being a queen.

731
01:48:45,271 --> 01:48:47,438
A fish doesn't die by drowning.

732
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:50,355
Then what's her weakness?

733
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:52,230
There must be something.

734
01:48:52,646 --> 01:48:53,938
Forget her weakness.

735
01:48:54,271 --> 01:48:55,896
Think of her strength first.

736
01:48:56,188 --> 01:48:57,521
Raghav.

737
01:48:57,605 --> 01:48:59,521
Target her strength.

738
01:49:00,063 --> 01:49:02,230
Destroy her confidence with Raghav.

739
01:49:02,605 --> 01:49:04,771
And her fortress will shatter like glass.

740
01:49:44,521 --> 01:49:50,021

Our only support is you, ♪

741

Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Ram.

749
01:50:59,521 --> 01:51:00,896
Hail, Lankesh.

750
01:51:04,688 --> 01:51:09,813
We may have under-estimated
those two humans and their monkeys.

751
01:51:12,313 --> 01:51:14,480
There is a rumor that Raghav
possesses a magical quiver

752
01:51:14,563 --> 01:51:16,271
that never runs out of arrows.

753
01:51:19,688 --> 01:51:21,938
They've managed to build a bridge
over the sea

754
01:51:22,230 --> 01:51:24,396
and are headed towards Lanka
as we speak.

755
01:51:29,355 --> 01:51:32,188
Prey has fallen right into the trap.

756
01:51:33,813 --> 01:51:34,896
Time to chew it.

757
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:39,563
There are thousands of monkeys
in their army.

758
01:51:40,105 --> 01:51:41,605
A few can fly as well.

759
01:51:41,688 --> 01:51:43,355
And one spy in their midst.

760
01:51:48,146 --> 01:51:50,396
A spy of Raavan.

761
01:52:11,105 --> 01:52:11,980
Marvelous!

762
01:52:13,021 --> 01:52:14,563
You are second to none...

763
01:52:15,105 --> 01:52:16,896
when it comes to brains and brawn.

764
01:52:19,021 --> 01:52:24,188
Simply standing next to one such as you
is enough to make me feel victorious.

765
01:52:26,105 --> 01:52:27,396
I've been thinking.

766
01:52:27,896 --> 01:52:29,896
What should our next plan of action be?

767
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:33,480
Should we assault Lanka first,

768
01:52:34,396 --> 01:52:36,521
or should we wait for them to attack?

769
01:52:39,646 --> 01:52:43,688
Are there any more monkey warriors
who can fly like Bajrang?

770
01:52:58,230 --> 01:53:00,688
Yes, there are.

771
01:53:02,021 --> 01:53:03,688
Angad, Sugriv, and...

772
01:53:05,438 --> 01:53:06,771
Jamavant.

773
01:53:08,355 --> 01:53:10,980
So there are three flying monkeys
in total.

774
01:53:14,021 --> 01:53:15,771
What are you doing, Raghav?

775
01:53:15,938 --> 01:53:17,230
Unhand me!

776
01:53:17,396 --> 01:53:19,480
I have sworn allegiance to you!

777
01:53:20,438 --> 01:53:22,688
The real Vibhishan knows
that Jamavant is not a monkey.

778
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:25,646
He is a bear.

779
01:53:29,188 --> 01:53:30,313
Reveal yourself.

780
01:53:56,146 --> 01:53:58,813
It's all too easy to kill an enemy
but not the enmity within him.

781
01:54:00,813 --> 01:54:02,230
The only way to do so
is through forgiveness.

782
01:54:05,605 --> 01:54:08,021
Let's give it a try,
and turn a foe into a friend.

783
01:54:10,105 --> 01:54:11,438
Where is Vibhishan?

784
01:54:24,438 --> 01:54:25,813
What do you want?

785
01:54:27,355 --> 01:54:28,521
I am Shuka,

786
01:54:28,771 --> 01:54:29,938
a spy

787
01:54:30,771 --> 01:54:31,896
of Lankesh.

788
01:54:34,688 --> 01:54:36,480
I had come to gather intelligence.

789
01:54:36,730 --> 01:54:38,188
And what did you find?

790
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,813
Angad,

791
01:54:47,396 --> 01:54:50,063
give our guest a complete tour
of our camp.

792
01:54:50,646 --> 01:54:53,146
Have him meet our monkey warriors.

793
01:54:53,230 --> 01:54:55,230
Show him our arsenal, too.

794
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,730
Once he's seen every corner of our camp,

795
01:54:58,855 --> 01:55:01,480
return him safely to the palace.

796
01:55:49,188 --> 01:55:51,646
You wanted the inside
information, right?

797
01:55:53,563 --> 01:55:55,188
Your spy will give you that.

798
01:55:55,563 --> 01:55:57,646
But what I am going tell you
is far more critical.

799
01:55:58,188 --> 01:56:00,521
Your ten heads should pay attention.

800
01:56:00,813 --> 01:56:03,688
Listen carefully,

801
01:56:05,271 --> 01:56:07,230
for I won't repeat myself.

802
01:56:09,313 --> 01:56:11,813
Before dawn breaks tomorrow,

803
01:56:12,563 --> 01:56:14,605
you must return Janaki to us.

804
01:56:15,438 --> 01:56:18,146
Say Hail Shri Ram...

805
01:56:18,521 --> 01:56:20,521
and save your life.

806
01:56:20,855 --> 01:56:23,021
Or else, your palace...

807
01:56:23,563 --> 01:56:25,813
had better prepare for your funeral.

808
02:05:33,396 --> 02:05:35,521
This is not an illusion!

809
02:05:37,396 --> 02:05:40,063
Start mourning for him. He is gone.

810
02:05:41,146 --> 02:05:44,813
Now just wrap up and leave Lanka!

811
02:05:45,146 --> 02:05:47,438
We are done with your monkey show.

812
02:05:50,938 --> 02:05:53,980
By morning,
the shores better be empty...

813
02:05:54,063 --> 02:05:55,313
Unless you wish to experience

814
02:05:56,938 --> 02:06:02,480
You just saw what my one
snake did to your Sheshnaag.

815
02:06:02,813 --> 02:06:05,230
I have many more
from where he came from.

816
02:06:13,646 --> 02:06:14,938
Raghav,

817
02:06:16,771 --> 02:06:19,105
your monkeys are wild and dumb,

818
02:06:20,105 --> 02:06:22,063
but you are a smart one, aren't you?

819
02:06:23,605 --> 02:06:26,021
So before the dawn breaks tomorrow...

820
02:06:52,521 --> 02:06:54,105
He can still be saved.

821
02:06:58,688 --> 02:07:01,813
There is only one way to stop the effect
of Indrajit's venom.

822
02:07:04,146 --> 02:07:05,813
I've never tried it but...

823
02:07:07,938 --> 02:07:09,980
I have heard about its effectiveness.

824
02:07:11,188 --> 02:07:12,521
The path to get there is fraught with--

825
02:07:12,605 --> 02:07:13,938
Tell me the name...

826
02:07:15,105 --> 02:07:16,521
and where to acquire it.

827
02:07:16,771 --> 02:07:18,063
Sanjeevani.

828
02:07:21,646 --> 02:07:23,355
On the mountain Dronagiri.

829
02:07:25,021 --> 02:07:26,313
Dronagiri...

830
02:07:29,521 --> 02:07:31,563
To reach it and return...

831
02:07:31,896 --> 02:07:33,396
it would take days.

832
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:38,938
It's not possible.

833
02:07:42,188 --> 02:07:43,438
Yes, it is.

834
02:07:45,105 --> 02:07:46,813
It can be done.

835
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:00,646
But how will I recognize
this Sanjeevani?

836
02:08:05,271 --> 02:08:07,105
Sanjeevani is neither a fruit

837
02:08:07,771 --> 02:08:10,688
nor a leaf nor a flower.

838
02:08:14,355 --> 02:08:16,688
It neither gets greener
during springtime,

839
02:08:17,521 --> 02:08:19,313
nor dries up during the fall.

840
02:08:23,146 --> 02:08:25,105
It is neither fragrant

841
02:08:26,021 --> 02:08:27,313
nor does it have any order

842
02:08:34,105 --> 02:08:36,355
It is neither as soft as a lotus,

843
02:08:37,563 --> 02:08:39,188
nor thorny as the cactus.

844
02:08:51,438 --> 02:08:53,646
Sanjeevani is Sanjeevani.

845
02:08:55,605 --> 02:08:57,313
That's the only way to describe it.

846
02:08:59,938 --> 02:09:01,813
Today one is hurt,

847
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,188
tomorrow there may be more.

848
02:09:06,438 --> 02:09:08,605
We need to keep Sanjeevani handy.

849
02:09:10,271 --> 02:09:11,730
We need to be prepared.

850
02:11:08,646 --> 02:11:11,896
(Chanting Mantra)

851
02:12:21,438 --> 02:12:22,730
Hail, Lankesh.

852
02:12:22,896 --> 02:12:25,771
Sorry to interrupt during your massage.

853
02:12:26,105 --> 02:12:27,980
Shesh, is still alive.

854
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:30,938
Indrajit venom has only one cure.

855
02:12:31,938 --> 02:12:33,938
And no one is aware about it.

856
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:40,938
Vibhishan,

857
02:12:42,271 --> 02:12:43,688
Vibhishan,

858
02:12:43,938 --> 02:12:45,688
Vibhishan.

859
02:12:49,313 --> 02:12:52,980
I will not spare you for this betrayal.

860
02:12:56,021 --> 02:13:05,480
I will not stop till I drain the blood
from your body down to the last drop,

861
02:13:07,855 --> 02:13:10,855
else I will not claim
to be Vishrawa son.

862
02:13:12,438 --> 02:13:14,521
You have betrayed Lanka.

863
02:13:22,188 --> 02:13:25,021
Lankesh never steps on
the battlefield first.

864
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:29,813
He will strategically send
his two best warriors before him.

865
02:13:31,188 --> 02:13:32,188
Indrajit and...

866
02:13:32,271 --> 02:13:33,646
Kumbhkaran.

867
02:13:34,521 --> 02:13:36,146
Indrajit is a master of illusions.

868
02:13:37,438 --> 02:13:39,480
But every poison has a cure,

869
02:13:40,563 --> 02:13:42,521
just like every enemy has a weakness.

870
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:45,730
And Indrajit's weakness lies...

871
02:13:46,271 --> 02:13:47,563
in the golden lake.

872
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:51,896
He takes a holy bath in the lake
before every fight.

873
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:53,563
This is his war ritual.

874
02:13:55,063 --> 02:13:57,355
And once he comes out of it,

875
02:13:57,896 --> 02:13:59,688
he is impossible to beat.

876
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:02,980
But for as long as he is in the water,

877
02:14:03,646 --> 02:14:06,230
he is without any powers.

878
02:14:07,396 --> 02:14:09,105
Then that's what we will do.

879
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:11,980
We will kill him in the water.

880
02:14:14,230 --> 02:14:17,480
Lankesh's second warrior is Kumbhkaran.

881
02:14:18,521 --> 02:14:21,521
It has been said time and again
that his strength is so mighty

882
02:14:23,063 --> 02:14:24,688
that it can stop
the Earth from rotating.

883
02:14:27,188 --> 02:14:28,938
But he is in deep slumber now...

884
02:14:30,355 --> 02:14:32,230
and won't wake up
for the next six months.

885
02:14:33,271 --> 02:14:34,730
Tomorrow is an auspicious day,

886
02:14:34,813 --> 02:14:38,230
and Lankesh will worship Lord Shiva
in the Shiva Temple.

887
02:14:39,521 --> 02:14:43,605
He won't take a break
until the whole ritual is completed.

888
02:14:44,980 --> 02:14:47,521
We will attack Lanka from
three directions at the same time.

889
02:14:53,146 --> 02:14:54,855
The first is Sugriv.

890
02:14:55,146 --> 02:14:56,646
You will be responsible

891
02:14:56,730 --> 02:14:59,271
for assaulting the northern wall
with a battalion.

892
02:15:02,188 --> 02:15:03,688
Shesh,

893
02:15:04,021 --> 02:15:05,730
go with Vibhishan and Angad.

894
02:15:05,813 --> 02:15:08,730
Cross the port entrance
to reach the golden lake.

895
02:15:09,021 --> 02:15:11,563
You will kill Indrajit
as we have planned.

896
02:15:13,188 --> 02:15:14,605
And I, along with Bajrang,

897
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:17,396
will infiltrate the enemy camp
from inside.

898
02:15:18,855 --> 02:15:21,355
If ever any one of you needs help,

899
02:15:22,271 --> 02:15:24,313
I will be there.

900
02:15:25,605 --> 02:15:28,480
But how will you manage to get
from one place to the next quickly?

901
02:15:29,730 --> 02:15:32,355
That responsibility rests on my shoulders.

902
02:15:36,230 --> 02:15:37,730
Let's get ready.

903
02:16:06,105 --> 02:16:08,438
The reason for which
we went through dense jungles,

904
02:16:08,521 --> 02:16:10,688
scaled mountains, and crossed the sea...

905
02:16:11,021 --> 02:16:13,271
The time has come to
fulfill that vow!

906
02:16:15,396 --> 02:16:17,521
Our enemy's army may outnumber us,

907
02:16:17,896 --> 02:16:21,896
but we more than make up for in courage!

908
02:16:22,355 --> 02:16:25,230
We fight for the truth.

909
02:16:27,230 --> 02:16:29,230
This fight won't be easy.

910
02:16:30,063 --> 02:16:32,355
You might lose faith,

911
02:16:35,063 --> 02:16:38,355
you might want to drop your weapon,

912
02:16:39,188 --> 02:16:45,146
you might feel like giving up.

913
02:16:48,063 --> 02:16:51,146
But before you decide to surrender,

914
02:16:52,146 --> 02:16:56,230
think once how you will face any women

915
02:16:58,563 --> 02:17:00,230
how did you loose to evil
and come back alive

916
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:07,938
The truth might suffer

917
02:17:08,438 --> 02:17:10,063
but will never fail.

918
02:17:10,813 --> 02:17:13,188
Har Har Mahadev!

919
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:16,021
Har Har Mahadev!

920
02:17:17,730 --> 02:17:19,313
This fight was mine.

921
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:22,355
But one by one,
you all became a part of it.

922
02:17:23,605 --> 02:17:25,396
And for that,
I'm deeply grateful to all of you.

923
02:17:27,938 --> 02:17:29,271
But today...

924
02:17:30,105 --> 02:17:31,896
Do not fight for me!

925
02:17:34,105 --> 02:17:36,021
Fight for yourself.

926
02:17:36,896 --> 02:17:43,646
Fight for the future where mothers will raise
their children with tales of your bravery.

927
02:17:45,855 --> 02:17:53,771
Fight for the day when the unrighteous will tremble
with fear before laying hands on any woman.

928
02:17:54,063 --> 02:17:56,021
Fight for that glory,

929
02:17:58,188 --> 02:18:06,230
where people will bow down with respect
when they hear your name.

930
02:18:08,271 --> 02:18:10,313
Do not just fight for me!

931
02:18:10,521 --> 02:18:12,855
Instead, fight for all of us!

932
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:15,813
Fight for our righteousness!

933
02:18:17,146 --> 02:18:18,480
Will you fight?

934
02:18:18,563 --> 02:18:19,980
Will fight

935
02:18:20,688 --> 02:18:22,563
Then march on

936
02:18:22,688 --> 02:18:27,438
and pierce the enemy's hearts
with the saffron victory flag!

937
02:18:27,521 --> 02:18:30,396
- Wherever Raghav is.
- There lies victory.

938
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:32,646
- Wherever Raghav is.
- There lies victory.

939
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:35,188
- Wherever Raghav is.
- There lies victory.

940
02:18:35,271 --> 02:18:38,855
- Wherever Raghav is.
- There lies victory.

941
02:18:38,896 --> 02:18:42,105
- Wherever Raghav is.
- There lies victory.

942
02:23:21,730 --> 02:23:28,688
♪ Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Ram,
Jai Shri Ram, Raja Ram! ♪

943
02:23:28,771 --> 02:23:35,980
♪ Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Ram,
Jai Shri Ram, Raja Ram! ♪

944
02:32:28,938 --> 02:32:30,813
I know your blessings are with me,

945
02:32:32,188 --> 02:32:34,230
and that ensures my win.

946
02:32:37,438 --> 02:32:39,271
But if I lose today...

947
02:32:43,271 --> 02:32:44,813
I am coming to you.

948
02:44:42,730 --> 02:44:43,771
I...

949
02:44:44,313 --> 02:44:45,938
Brahma, creator of the universe

950
02:44:48,646 --> 02:44:50,563
bestows this boon upon you.

951
02:44:55,521 --> 02:44:57,563
Neither in the night nor in the day,

952
02:45:02,063 --> 02:45:03,771
neither in the water nor in the air,

953
02:45:05,313 --> 02:45:06,813
neither on the ground...

954
02:45:10,313 --> 02:45:11,730
nor in the sky,

955
02:45:15,521 --> 02:45:17,230
neither at the hands of Gods...

956
02:45:20,855 --> 02:45:22,688
or demons...

957
02:45:26,105 --> 02:45:27,896
shall death ever befall on you.
