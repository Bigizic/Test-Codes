## 1: Armstrong number:

### Instructions

An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:

30 is not an Armstrong number, because 30 != 3^2
+ 0^2 = 9

2 is an Armstrong number,
because 2 == 2^1 = 2

370 is an Armstrong number, because 370 == 3^3
+ 7^3 + 0^3 = 370

## 2: isogram:

## Instructions

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram

An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

timber
house
stream
six-year-old

The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.
