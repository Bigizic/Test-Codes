## 1: Armstrong_number:
### Instructions
An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:
30 is not an Armstrong number, because 30 != 3^2 + 0^2 = 9

2 is an Armstrong number, because 2 == 2^1 = 2

370 is an Armstrong number, because 370 == 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 370
